# Bloxburg-Macro

how to set up

1. this macro requires a monitor scale of 100% and a 1920x1080 monitor because IT WON'T WORK (also your screen has to be full screen).
   because of stuff in the game being smaller or bigger depending on your scale/resolution, this will probably apply
   for your character's age and whatever, tutorial whenever this is finished
   
2. this will need a specifc build at your plot because of rotation purposes. there will be a video
   tutorial at some point because this is a WORK ON PROGRESS

3. this WILL require AutoHotkey Version 2.0

DON'T GO TO THEIR DISCORD AND ASK FOR HELP THERE, this is an occuring thing with natro.
and overall i won't help because troubleshooting this is a hell because of many variables
and how the game is not really good with camera rotations. this will be a great challenge
