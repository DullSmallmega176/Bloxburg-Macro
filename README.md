# Bloxburg-Macro

how to set up

1. this macro requires a monitor scale of 100% and a 1920x1080 monitor because IT WON'T WORK (also roblox has to be full screen).
   because of stuff in the game being smaller or bigger depending on your scale/resolution, this will probably apply
   for your character's age and whatever.

2. this WILL require AutoHotkey Version 2.0

3. The macro has a variable inside the code used for setting a time limit
   This is mostly for advanced users, it is defaulted to 30 minutes, but 
   you can change it as to whatever time you want (seconds)

Have fun and enjoy the macro, don't abuse it too much.
